        Welcome to my Portfolio! I am currently learning to be a Web Developer from the University of Utah's online bootcamp course. The Course took 6 months and I learned many things every week and I applied that knowledge to complete challenges that were due every week for 24 weeks. It's been challenging but I enjoyed it all and meeting new people. My goal after this, is to learn more and perfect everything that I didn't really understand after this course is complete.
